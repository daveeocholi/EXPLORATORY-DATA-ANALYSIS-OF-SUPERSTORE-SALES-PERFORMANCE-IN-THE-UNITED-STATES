# Exploratory Data Analysis of Superstore Sales Performance in the United States

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Superstore Sales dataset** to uncover key insights related to sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, product trends, and shipping efficiency across various U.S. regions.

Conducted using **Microsoft Excel**, the project follows a structured data analysis workflow including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Dashboard development
- Business recommendations

The objective is to extract actionable insights to support strategic business decision-making in areas such as inventory management, pricing, marketing, and logistics.

## Project Objectives

- Clean and prepare raw data for analysis
- Measure overall sales and profit performance
- Identify top-performing and underperforming product categories
- Analyze the impact of discount rates on profit margins
- Compare shipping methods in terms of cost-effectiveness and delivery time
- Assess regional and state-wise sales trends
- Understand customer segment contributions to revenue
- Deliver actionable recommendations based on findings

## Dataset Used

The dataset includes detailed transaction records from a U.S.-based Superstore, with the following key attributes:

- **Order Details:** Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Shipping Cost, Discount
- **Customer Information:** Customer ID, Name, Segment
- **Product Information:** Category, Sub-Category, Unit Price
- **Financial Metrics:** Quantity Sold, Sales, Profit, Profit Margin
- **Geographical Data:** Region, State, City, Postal Code

---

## Key Questions Explored

- Which products and categories drive the most and least profit?
- What is the optimal discount rate to maximize profit?
- How do different shipping methods compare in terms of cost and profit?
- What regions and states generate the highest/lowest sales?
- Which customer segments are most valuable to the business?
- How does geography impact shipping efficiency and profitability?

---

## Processes Involved in Analysis

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values in key fields (e.g., profit, shipping cost)
- Standardized date formats and calculated processing time
- Created new calculated metrics:
  - `Profit Margin (%) = (Profit / Sales) * 100`
  - `Discount Impact Factor = Sales Before Discount - Sales After Discount`

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Aggregated data to evaluate sales and profit by:
  - Product category & sub-category
  - State & region
  - Customer segment
- Analyzed discount effects on profitability
- Assessed shipping mode efficiency

---

## Processes Involved in Dashboard Building

- Built interactive Pivot Tables for filtering and summarizing key metrics
- Designed visualizations using Excel Charts:
  - Line charts for monthly trends
  - Bar and column charts for profit comparison
  - Pie charts for segment contributions
  - Scatter plots for discount vs. profit correlation
  - Geographic maps for state-wise sales distribution
- Aligned charts with business KPIs for clarity

## Recommendations and Insights

### 1. Sales & Profitability
- **Office Supplies** generate the highest profit margin.
- **Furniture** performs poorly and may require repricing or supplier evaluation.

### 2. Discount Strategy
- Profitability declines significantly beyond a **20% discount threshold**.
- Consider limiting deep discounts or applying selectively by segment.

### 3. Shipping & Logistics
- **Delivery Truck** yields the highest profit-to-cost ratio.
- **Express Air** incurs high costs and should be used for premium orders only.

### 4. Regional Performance
- **California** is the top-performing state; further investment is recommended.
- **North Carolina** underperforms in both profit and sales.

### 5. Customer Segmentation
- **Corporate clients** drive the highest revenue.
- **Home Office** customers are most discount-sensitive and may respond to targeted offers.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Excel can be used as a powerful tool for end-to-end data analysis. By leveraging structured EDA techniques, meaningful visualizations, and business logic, actionable insights were extracted from raw data. The results support strategic planning in product management, pricing, marketing, logistics, and customer targeting.
